<h1>Mobile Computing Architecture</h1>
A 3-tier architecture is an application program that is organized into three major parts, comprising of:

The data access layer tier at the bottom,
The application tier (business logic) in the middle and
The client tier (presentation) at the top.
Each tier is distributed to a different place or places in a network. These tiers do not necessarily correspond to physical locations on various computers on a network, but rather to logical layers of the application.
<h3>1. Presentation Layer (UI):</h2>
This layer presents data to the user and optionally permits data manipulation and data entry, also this layer requests the data form Business layer.

This layer accomplished through use of Dynamic HTML and client-side data sources and data cursors.
<h3>2. Business Logic Layer:</h3>
1.The business logic acts as the server for client requests from workstations. It acts according Business rules fetch or insert data through the Data Layer.
2.In turn, it determines what data is needed (and where it is located) and acts as a client in relation to a third tier of programming that might be located on a local or mainframe computer.

3.Because these middle-tier components are not tied to a specific client, they can be used by all applications and can be moved to different locations, as response time and other rules require.
<h3>3. Data Access Layer:</h3>
The third tier of the 3-tier system is made up of the DBMS that provides all the data for the above two layers.

This is the actual DBMS access layer.

Avoiding dependencies on the storage mechanisms allows for updates or changes without the application tier clients being affected by or even aware of the change.
<h1>STRUCTURE OF MOBILE COMPUTING APPLICATION</h1>
<h3>programming language</h3>
Programming languages are used for mobile system software. Operating system functions to run the software components onto the hardware. Middleware components deployment. Layered structure arrangement of mobile computing components is used. Protocols and layers are used for transmission and reception.

·        Java - J2SE    J2ME (Java2 Micro edition)

·        JavaCard (Java for smart card)
·        The Java enterprise edition (J2EE) used for web and enterprise server based applications of mobile services
·        C and C++
·        Visual C++
·        Visual Basic
<h3>Operating System</h3>
Symbian OS, Window CE, Mac OS are the operating systems used in Mobile computing applications. It offers the user to run an application without considering the hardware specifications and functionalities. It provides functions which are used for scheduling the multiple tasks in a system.
It provides the functions required for the synchronization of multiple tasks in the system. It uses multiple threads synchronization and priority allocation. Management functions (such as creation, activation, deletion, suspension, and delay) are used for tasks and memory. It provides Interfaces for communication between software components at the application layer, middleware layers, and hardware devices.
It facilitates the execution of software components on diversified hardware. It provides Configurable libraries for the GUI (graphic user interface) in the device. It provides
User application‘s GUIs, VUI (voice user interface) components, and phone API. It provides the device drivers for the keyboard, display, USB, and other devices.

 <h3>Middleware</h3>

 

Software components that link the application components with the network-distributed components. It is used to discover the nearby device such as Bluetooth. It is used to discover the nearby hot spot for achieving device synchronization with the server or an enterprise server. It is used for retrieving data (which may be in Oracle or DB2) from a network database. It is used for service discovery at network. It is used for adaptation of the application to the platform and service availability.
